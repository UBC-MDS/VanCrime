## App Strengths
Our app has several strengths that have been highlighted by both our peers and TA. These include the use of interactive widgets that allow users to filter data based on their interests, as well as multiple visualization options that enable users to analyze data in different ways. The crime trend chart is another strong feature of our app that allows users to easily compare neighbourhoods and see trends across years.

Our app also provides a map for visualization, which has been well received by users. The map plot is interactive, allowing users to hover over data points and see detailed information. Overall, the dashboard layout is simple and user-friendly, which has been appreciated by our users.

## What we fixed 
We have also received feedback from our peers and TA on some improvements that we have made to the app. For example, we moved the crime map to the first tab and added a dynamic text stating the top 1-3 crimes of the selected neighbourhood/crime type to make it more engaging and informative. We have also fixed an issue where users would receive an internal error message when deselecting all in the widget and added a more user-friendly error message instead. Additionally, we fixed an issue where the trend plot would be empty when only one year was selected and added top three crime type text to the map to provide more specific and relevant information to users.

In conclusion, we have received valuable feedback from our peers and TA throughout the development of our app. We have worked to address some of the weaknesses in our dashboard and have made improvements based on user feedback. We will continue to seek feedback and make improvements to ensure that our app is meeting the needs and expectations of our users.

## What we can improve
Despite these strengths, there are some weaknesses in our dashboard that we do not have time to address. One common issue that users have pointed out is that it can be difficult to differentiate between neighbourhoods on the map as their size is not immediately visible. We have been considering different solutions to this problem, including making the neighbourhoods static so that their sizes are visible at all times.

Another limitation of our map plot is that it currently lacks a two-way binding with the widget, which would allow users to directly filter the data on the map and see its effect on the other plots. This is a feature that we are actively working on implementing in the future.
