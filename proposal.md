# Section 2: Description of Data

We will be visualizing a dataset of crime data happened between 2003 and 2021 from Vancouver Police Department (VPD). It contains approximately 80,000 entries. Each of the entries denotes a crime happened in a specific location at a specific time.

Each crime has 10 associated variables that describe the crime type (`TYPE`), date/time (`YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`), and the location (`HUNDRED_BLOCK`, `NEIGHBOURHOOD`, `X` and `Y`).

The dataset includes information about eleven types of crime. `X` and `Y` are coordinate values projected in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 10. There are some missing location data. Part of that is due to privacy issue.
