# VanCrime

## Overview

This repository hosts the dashboard for the Vancouver (Canada) crime data released by the Vancouver Police Department ([VPD](https://vpd.ca/)). This information, which spans 2003 through 2022, is public domain and is licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Background and purpose of this dashboard can be found in our [proposal](proposal.md).

## Description of the Dashboard

We will create 4 different visualizations within the dashboard. \* The first plot is a map chart that displays the distribution of Vancouver crime across different regions. To further illustrate this distribution, we plan to use a color scale. Additionally, we aim to enhance its functionality by allowing users to filter crime data in the other three plots by simply clicking on a particular region of the map. \* The second plot is a dynamic bar chart that shows crime types based on user input from the widget on the right. \* The third plot shows total number of crimes per year in each neighbourhood. \* The fourth plot is a time series chart that displays the number of crimes within a selected time range, based on user input.

The following actions can be performed on our dashboard :

-   Specify the year interval (from and to years) from the slider control.
-   Filter the visualizations based on a desired neighbourhood and hundred block from the dropdowns.
-   Filter the neighbourhood by clicking on a particular area in the crime map <br>
